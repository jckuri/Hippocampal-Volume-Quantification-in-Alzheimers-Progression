# Validation Plan

## What is the intended use of the product?

This software is capable of quantifying the hippocampal volume of patients in order to keep track of their Alzheimer's progression.

This software is not intended to replace doctors. It is rather intended to help doctors keep track of the progressions of their patients with Alzheimer disease. So that, this software will alleviate the work overall of doctors. Moreover, patients and their relatives can also see the reports of this software and be more aware of the progression of Alzheimer disease.

## How was the training data collected?

The training data is made of MRI brain scans of multiple patients of both genders (male and female) and with different ages.

Once the MRI brain scans are taken, doctors cropped the volumes in which the hippocampuses are located.

## How did you label your training data?

The silver standard was used in which a group of doctors sat down and annotated the voxels they think compose the hippocampus in every volume.

The gold standard is not used here and consists in taking the MRI brain scans with a special chemical that acts as a constrast and marks the hippocampus in a special way.

## How was the training performance of the algorithm measured and how is the real-world performance going to be estimated?
